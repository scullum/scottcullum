# Scott M. Cullum's Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio website with a distinctive punk/glitch aesthetic, showcasing my work as a creative technologist and strategist.

## Design Philosophy

This site embodies a unique design system that balances technical innovation with user experience:

- **Punk/Glitch Aesthetic**: Visual elements feature subtle skew effects and glitch animations

- **Interactive Elements**: Toggle controls allow visitors to customize their experience

## Technical Implementation

Built with modern web technologies:

- **Next.js 15**: Leveraging the latest App Router and React 19 features
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for better code quality and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design system integration
- **Dynamic Components**: Client/server hybrid architecture for optimal performance

## Key Features

- **Skewed Elements**: Containers, text, and UI elements with configurable skew effects
- **Theme Management**: Light/dark mode with persistent settings via localStorage
- **Effects Toggle**: Combined control for skew and animation effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
